																											 className fxn in JS
																											 
			
			The className property sets or returns the class name of an element (the value of an element's class attribute).

            Tip: A similar property to className is the classList property.

			document.getElementById("myDIV").className = "mystyle";                      IT WILL TAKE WHATEVER ELEMENT HAS ID myDIV and add class "mystyle" to it	
			
			
			                                                                                                replece("2","3")  fxn
																											
																											
			Replace  	element two with element 3


                                                                                                            event.target

			event.target.parentElement.className += ' active';          SPACE REQD
